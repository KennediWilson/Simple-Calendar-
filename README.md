This Calendar prompts the user to enter a date in the mm/dd format and incorporates input validation to ensure the month and day are valid numeric values within proper ranges. It defines several well-structured functions—including main, calendar, line, date_range, spacing, and print_date_left—to modularize and organize the program. A for loop is used to display five weeks of the calendar, with formatted output using f-strings to align the dates neatly. The program utilizes the datetime module to retrieve and display the current date using datetime.datetime.now(). To handle unexpected or invalid input gracefully, it employs a try-except block, alongside conditional statements for program control and validation. Finally, the script includes a main guard (if __name__ == "__main__":) to ensure that the main function runs only when the script is executed directly, allowing it to behave appropriately when imported as a module.
